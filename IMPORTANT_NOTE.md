# Important: After First Successful Startup

Once the application starts successfully and loads sample data, change this line in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
```

Back to:

```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

This prevents losing your data every time you restart the application.

## Why This Was Needed

The database schema was corrupted or mismatched with the JPA entities. Using `create` mode forces Hibernate to drop and recreate all tables cleanly.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Set to `create` mode for first run
- ✅ Fixed deprecated MySQL8Dialect → MySQLDialect
- ⏳ Waiting for first successful run
- ⏳ After success, change back to `update` mode
